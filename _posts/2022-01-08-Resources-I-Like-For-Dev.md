## Podcasts

### Dev

These are some of my favorite podcasts to listen to when I want to learn about the newest technologies, strategies, methodologies, etc... Some of these shows have been invaluable in my learning experience thus far.

#### Coding Blocks

[![img](https://www.codingblocks.net/wp-content/uploads/dynamik-gen/theme/images/cb-wide-400x72.png)](https://codingblocks.net)

CodingBlocks is a fantastic show run by [Allen Underwood](http://www.linkedin.com/in/allenunderwood), [Joe Zack](http://www.linkedin.com/in/joezack) and [Michael Outlaw](https://linkedin.com/in/michaeloutlaw) (what a name, am I right?). This is by far my favorite development podcast. I try to keep up to date and listen whenever possible. I can't even begin to give enough credit where it's due here. So much of my learning has come either directly from this show, or from recommendations they've made. On top of that, these guys are absolutely hilarious!  Definitely give the show a listen if work in the field, or have interest in development, devops, or other related spaces.

#### The .NET Core Podcast

[<img src="https://dotnetcore.show/img/logo.svg" alt=".NET Core Podcast" width="200"/>](https://dotnetcore.show/)

Hosted by Jamie ["GaProgMan"](https://github.com/GaProgMan) Taylor, The .NET Core Podcast is a production of [RJJ Software Ltd](https://rjj-software.co.uk/). The show focuses on all things .NET related (and some not). With superb production value, the interview style show does an excellent job delivering excellent content for anyone interested in .NET or development in general. I never miss an episode and strongly recommend checking it out!

#### Tabs & Spaces

[![img](https://tabsandspaces.io/static/header-logo-ee134b97996ecc3e6e4633d08608e239.svg)](https://tabsandspaces.io/)

"A straight shooting podcast that talks about software development topics that developers care about"

Tabs & Spaces is hosted by [Zac Braddy](https://zackerthehacker.com/), [Jamie Taylor](https://about.me/thejamietaylor) (the same Jamie Taylor from [The .NET Core Podcast](#the-net-core-podcast)), and [James Studdart](https://github.com/JamesStuddart) (who also hosts [The Cynical Developer](#the-cynical-developer)). The show consistently covers interesting topics and questions that many of us in and around the development space ask ourselves. The format is very conversational, and genuinely funny and entertaining. While tangents most definitely occur, they always leave me laughing and wanting more.

#### Code Newbie

[![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codenewbie-assets/medium/CNP_Purple_%281%29.png)](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast)

Code newbie is a fantastic resources for newer programmers. The show is conversational, and primarily focuses around front end development. The host [Saron Yitbarek](https://saron.io) is the producer of several podcasts and has an interesting public speaking history. While the topics often lean towards the front-end side of things, more recently they have branched out a bit. I recommend giving it a listen if you're looking for an easy listen from host who is easy to listen to and has spent the better part of the past decade as an advocate for developers both in her podcasts and other parts of the community.

## Libraries and other code resources

In this section you'll find libraries and other code resources. If you have a suggestion, drop a comment!

### Cocona

A micro-framework for .NET Core console applications. Cocona makes it easy and fast to build console applications on .NET.ðŸš€

### Sharprompt

An Interactive command-line based application framework for C#.

### Spectre.Console

Spectre.Console is a .NET 5/.NET Standard 2.0 library that makes it easier to create beautiful, cross platform, console applications.
It is heavily inspired by the excellent Rich library for Python.

While [Sharprompt](#sharprompt) is an excellent tool for simple CLI application development, I found Spectre.Console to be significantly more robust and useful. As I was actively developing [IISLogManager](https://github.com/Coast-Technologies/IISLogManager.Core) (currently very much on the back burner) I found that this tool set was invaluable in creating a useful interactive CLI.

### UnitsNet

Add strongly typed quantities to your code and get merrily on with your life.

No more magic constants found on Stack Overflow, no more second-guessing the unit of parameters and variables.
